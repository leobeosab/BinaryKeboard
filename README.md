# BinaryKeboard
A binary keyboard I made to to teach binary to friends or people who would like to learn. 

## About
I started this project to help teach binary. This is a useful and fun way for someone who doesn't quite understand how binary to ascii works. I'm switching out the tactile buttons used for mechanical key switches for an easier experience typing. 

Obviously it is not very practical as a standalone keyboard as typing 8 bits for every one keystroke is tiresome. Blog post and tutorial coming soon, for now here is the gist of the code

-- there will be a tutorial soon
